## 🧠 MultiAgent Vision Intelligence (MAVI)

A modular, multi-agent AI system that uses **LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)** to process images for **semantic understanding** and **similarity-based retrieval**. This project combines the strengths of vision-language models with autonomous agents to create a scalable, intelligent annotation and search engine.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Understand and query images using natural language prompts.
- 🔗 **Similarity Search**: Retrieve images with similar visual or contextual features.
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Independent agents handle tasks like embedding, querying, indexing, and reasoning.
- 🧩 **Pluggable Agents**: Easily swap models or services (e.g., LLaVA, FAISS, OpenAI, etc.)
- 🖼️ **Vision-Language Integration**: Powered by LLaVA for interpreting image content using LLMs.

## 🧱 Components

| Agent             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SemanticAgent`   | Uses LLaVA to perform reasoning and image captioning.                       |
| `SimilarityAgent` | Embeds input and finds similar items using vector DBs like FAISS or Qdrant. |
| `Controller`      | Routes user queries to the appropriate agent(s).                            |
| `Visualizer`      | Optional — overlays results, annotations, or outputs.                       |

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then:

* 📤 Upload an image or send a text prompt
* 🔁 Use endpoints like:

```
POST /search/semantic
POST /search/similarity
```
